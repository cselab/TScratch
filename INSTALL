TScratch download

TScratch is a software tool developed to automatically analyze wound healing
assays (scratch assays). It is available as a stand-alone application using
Matlab Compiler on Macintosh (Intel) OS X and PC (Windows) platforms. The
downloadable files below are available in two forms, one including the Matlab
Compiler Runtime (MCR) v7.8 engine, and one without it. If MCR 7.8 is not
installed on your computer, you will need the form including MCR. If you
already have MCR 7.8 installed (for example if you have MATLAB R2008a with
Matlab Compiler; you can check which version of MCR you have by writing
"mcrversion" at the MATLAB prompt), you can download the smaller file.

The manual with installation instructions is included in the zip-files
(TScratch_manual.pdf), but is also available here:
http://www.cse-lab.ethz.ch/images/software/tscratch_manual.pdf. Some
troubleshooting hints are provided below.

=======================================

The following TScratch packages are available at our repository.

Macintosh (Intel)

Please download the proper file and extract it using Archive Utility
(tscratch_nomcr_pkg.zip - a version which requires the user to have Matlab
Compiler Runtime (MCR) v7.8 installed (3 MB), tscratch_pkg_simple.zip - a
stand-alone application, includes MCR (206 MB)). The second file can be downloaded
from here: http://www.cse-lab.ethz.ch/images/software/tscratch_pkg_simple.zip.
Open TScratch_manual.pdf and read further installation instructions there. The installation procedure was
developed by Will Ashby, Vanderbilt University.

According to the Installation Instructions included in the second file (tscrach_pkg_simple.zip),
the Matlab runtime (v78) must be installed first and then TScratch must be copied into the Application folder.
The older version of the Matlab runtime does not interfere with the existing Matlab installation.
Moreover, you must have XQuartz installed (https://www.xquartz.org/). 
TScratch might fail to start (e.g. macOS Sierra) due to a missing function in libz.1.dylib.
In that case delete that file from the /Applications/MATLAB/MATLAB_Compiler_Runtime/v78/bin/maci folder.

Windows

Please download the proper file and extract it (tscratch_nomcr_win.zip - a
version which requires the user to have Matlab Compiler Runtime (MCR) v7.8
installed (3 MB), tscratch_win.zip - a stand-alone application, includes MCR
(231 MB)). The second file can be downloaded from here:
http://www.cse-lab.ethz.ch/images/software/tscratch_win.zip. 
Then double-click on TScratch_win.exe to unpack the program and
install MCR (if the version with MCR was downloaded). Then run TScratch.exe to
start the program. To the best of our knowledge the software works in Windows
XP, Vista and Windows 7. It was not tested on Windows 8, but might work there
too. We advise that you download and install the version with MCR in any case,
since it will be incompatible to more recent Matlab versions. In short you
should download the the Windows version with MCR, unzip it and execute the
resulting "TScratch_win" executable. This will only install MCR and should run
without errors. You can then execute the "TScratch" executable.

    Troubleshooting

    We have observed that on some machines depending on what is already
    installed, some libraries are not automatically installed. In such cases
    TScratch may fail to open without showing any errors. If this happens try
    the following: Find where MCR was installed (by default this is in
    "C:\Program Files (x86)\MATLAB\MATLAB Compiler Runtime\v78") Within that
    folder, you can find "vcredist_x86.exe" in the folder "bin\win32". Run this
    to install the missing libraries.

Source Code

You can also download the source code of TScratch (TScratch_src.zip). You will
need Matlab (R2008a or newer) and the CurveLab library (available at
www.curvelet.org) to run it.  Please consult the README file included in the
source code package for further instructions.

=======================================

Sample data set

This zip-file contains a sample data set from a wound-healing experiment:
[tscratch_sampledata.zip](http://www.cse-lab.ethz.ch/images/software/tscratch_sampledata.zip) (5 MB).
Download and unpack it to try out the TScratch program on some real data.

Authors

TScratch was developed by Tobias Gebäck and Martin Schulz, ETH Zürich.  The
Software is provided as-is, but very limited support might be provided by the
current members of the CSE lab (www.cse-lab.ethz.ch).
